This sample project executes a basic genetic algorithm intended to produce a binary string that
matches the user-defined binary string.

This project demonstrates the usage of the following features:
 - An extension of the built-in mutation operator, UniformBitMutationOperator, that adds a mutation
   feature which removes bits.
 - A custom validator that validates the user-defined string value to ensure it is a binary string.
